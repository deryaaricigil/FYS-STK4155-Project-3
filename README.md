EigenvalueSolver.ipynb is a neural network using the tensorflow keras neural network functionality. It solves the nonlinear differential equation which yields an eigenvector of a symmetric input matrix if properly optimized.<br>
PDESolver.ipynb is a neural network that solves the diffusion equation. <br>
The forward_euler_scheme.ipynb uses the explicit Euler method to approximate the diffusion equation numerically. <br>
